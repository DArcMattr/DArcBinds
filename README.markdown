I got tired of having to setup the same macros and clique binds for all my
toons, so I figured out how to do it all with an addon. My goal in designing
this collection was to make some convenient and commonly-used actions part of
the game interface itself, or to address some annoyances, like exiting from
vehicles, or the &ldquo;Set Focus menu option being broken for third-party raid
frames.

Provides for keybinds for the following areas:

<dl> 
<dt>Archaeology</dt>
<dd>Binds for Survey & open the archaeology panel</dd>
<dt>Raid Marks</dt>
<dd>Mouseover / target versions of the raid marker keybinds</dd>
<dt>World Markers</dt>
<dd>Lets you place/clear world markers, regardless of the raid manager pullout&rsquo;s error status.</dd>
<dt>Mounting</dt>
<dd>Combination dismount / leave vehicle keybind</dd>
<dt>Targeting</dt>
<dd>All-in-one focus mouseover / target and clearing; Pet attack mouseover / target; and assist focus.</dd>
</dl>

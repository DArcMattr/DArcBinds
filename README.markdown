Slim down your actionbar keybinds by moving more macros from your actionbars to
your muscle memory. The game's own UI is used. You will need to set the key
bindings to something you find makes sense for you..

I got tired of having to set up the same macros, Clique and key binds for all
my toons, so I figured out how to do it all with an addon. My goal in designing
this collection was to make some convenient and commonly-used actions part of
the game interface itself, or to address some annoyances, like exiting from
vehicles, or the &ldquo;Set Focus&rdquo; menu option being broken for
third-party raid frames.

Provides for additional keybinds for the following things, found in the Game
Menu under "Key Bindings" > "AddOns":

<dl>
<dt>Archaeology</dt>
<dd>Binds for Survey & open the archaeology panel</dd>
<dt>Fishing</dt>
<dd>Bind the fishing cast.</dd>
<dt>Raid Marks</dt>
<dd>Mouseover / target versions of the raid marker keybinds</dd>
<dt>World Markers</dt>
<dd>Lets you place/clear world markers, regardless of the raid manager pullout&rsquo;s error status.</dd>
<dt>Mounting</dt>
<dd>Combination dismount / leave vehicle keybind</dd>
<dt>Targeting Functions</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>All-in-one set focus as mouseover unit, using target as a fallback, or clear the focus if no unit is targeted or moused over
    <li>Swap targeted and focused units
    <li>Pet attack mouseover or targeted unit
    <li>Assist focus
  </ul>
</dd>
</dl>

I got tired of having to set up the same macros, Clique and key binds for all
my toons, so I figured out how to do it all with an addon. My goal in designing
this collection was to make some convenient and commonly-used actions part of
the game interface itself, or to address some annoyances, like exiting from
vehicles, or the &ldquo;Set Focus&rdquo; menu option being broken for
third-party raid frames.

Provides for keybinds for the following things:

<dl>
<dt>Archaeology</dt>
<dd>Binds for Survey & open the archaeology panel</dd>
<dt>Raid Marks</dt>
<dd>Mouseover / target versions of the raid marker keybinds</dd>
<dt>World Markers</dt>
<dd>Lets you place/clear world markers, regardless of the raid manager pullout&rsquo;s error status.</dd>
<dt>Mounting</dt>
<dd>Combination dismount / leave vehicle keybind</dd>
<dt>Targeting</dt>
<dd>
  All-in-one focus mouseover / target and clearing; Swap targeted and focused
  units; Pet attack mouseover / target; and assist focus
</dd>
<dt>Fishing</dt>
<dd>Now that it's possible to fish without a pole equipped, I'll move this from the macros to the keybinds in my setup</dd>
</dl>
